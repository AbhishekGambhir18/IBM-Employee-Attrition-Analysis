# IBM-Employee-Attrition-Analysis

# Repository Description:
This repository is dedicated to a project that analyzes and predicts employee attrition through decision tree-based models. Employee attrition, the involuntary or voluntary staff reduction, can significantly impact an organization's performance and reputation. 

# Objective:
The project aims to create predictive models that identify attrition-influencing factors and predict which employees are most likely to leave. 

# Significance:
Understanding attrition is crucial; it's a game-changer for maintaining a productive workforce and economic stability. By identifying key factors and at-risk employees, HR managers can design effective retention strategies to enhance employee satisfaction and loyalty, leading to a more stable and prosperous organization.
